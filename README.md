# Project Summary 
Starter code was created by Professor Dion at the University of Vermont. My partner for the project was Elizabeth Lembach. 

This program utilizes two languages to allow for an image manipulation. The program allows for users to input new images as long as they are 
in the form of a jpg, jpeg, or gif. Once the image is uploaded into the program, the user has the option to manipulate the picture into three different options. The three different options include flip, mirror, and invert.

Running the Program 
- The program begins with C++ and displays to the user, "Welcome to the image manipulator!"
- Then the programs asks the user to "Enter filename"
- Then "using file" will print
- Following, the program will print: "Select an option: " and given four choices with corresponding inputs
-    'a' for flip
-    'b' for mirror
-    'c' for invert
-    'd' for exit 
- After the user selects an option, the program will run and display "Processing. Go to Python program when it opens. May take a few seconds."
- Then the screen will pop up and display whatever the user has selected with the manipulation.

The options will either flip the original image over the x-asix or y-axis. If the invert option is chosen, the image creates a kaleideescope effect with the image flipping over the y-axis first and then that doubled image over the x-axis.

## Languages Used 
The languages used within this program include C++ and Python with a small portion of CMake.
